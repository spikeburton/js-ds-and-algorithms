# Data Structures & Algorithms in JavaScript
Stacks, Queues, Sets, Binary Search Trees, Linked Lists, etc. Loosely modeled after [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2CEgPsws3U) video on FreeCodeCamp, but modified to use CommonJS and modules to test with Node. Implemented using a combination of functional programming and object oriented programming.
